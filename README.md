Explanation of the eFootball Antenna Bar 
1 year ago I shared a post to explain the meaning of eFootball’s antenna bar. Here is the finding. 


The relationship between bar and latency is roughly correct. But with recent analysis, it's not determined by the server you are pairing, but the result of in-game speed test every 10 minutes. 
In eFootball, the game will do a speed test every 10 minutes. It’ll test the connection to all the 40 server locations.  
For example, here is one test result. The game can’t get result from Hong Kong server. Then during the next 10 minutes period, every match pairing from Hong Kong server shows 5 bar.  
The 70ms to Osaka is roughly 3 bar. So everyone from Osaka shows 3 bar, no matter 124ms latency should be 2 or 1 bar. 

So if you get a 5 bar match,  it doesn’t always mean the connection is perfect. Maybe it’s just because the game didn’t get the correct speed test result from previous test.  And it explains why someone complains about the lag of 5 bar match.
